# WhoWeAre
Documents about Innovationsverbund Öffentliche Gesundheit (InÖG)

## What one can find in here

Here we put documents about the Innovationsverbund Öffentliche Gesundheit. There is a lot of German involved, as we are an association based in Germany. We are currently working on English versions. Our statutes will always be in German due to legal reasons.

In the future there may be further organisational declarations, explanation and documents.

## Something should be changed?
For change requests of documents please create a pull request and add a short rationale for this change if appropriate or submit an issue, so there is a proper place for discussion. For typos etc. this is not necessary.
